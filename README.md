# tutorial_search_engine
This is a tutorial very simple search engine i made using the DuckDuckGo api.
You can use [textstudio-google-logo](https://www.textstudio.com/logo/google-logo-602) and save as transparent png and replace the **images\logo.png**

# How to use

Fork this repo, then change the logo, images, css and if you want to change the functionality.
Now delete the **README.md**, go to setings, go to pages and select the **main** branch and the folder **/ (root)** and hit **save**.
Wait a bit so it deploys and go to {your-username}.github.io/{your-repo-name} or if the name of the repo is the same as your username go to {your-username}.github.io
